# Smart_Attendance_Management_System
Developed a Java-based attendance management system to automate and
streamline attendance tracking. Implemented OOPs, exception handling,
and file handling to ensure secure and efficient data management.
Designed a role-based access system for administrators and employees,
improving accuracy and reducing manual errors. The project enhances
attendance tracking efficiency and is scalable for database or cloud
integration.

3. Exception Handling – Managing and controlling errors in a program to prevent crashes.


4. File Handling – Reading, writing, and managing files in a program.


5. Role-based Access System – A security model where users have specific permissions based on their role (e.g., admin vs. employee).


6. Scalable – A system that can handle more data, users, or functionality in the future without major changes.


7. Integration – Connecting different systems, like adding a database or cloud storage to an application.
